# statistical-analysis

This analysis is about the relationship between Universities and fresh graduate salaries depending on which University people went to during their undergraduate. This analysis is based on a couple questions of interest such as:
1. Do people graduate from University type 'X' have a higher salary than people graduating from University type 'Y' depending on the type of University (Engineering, Ivy League, Party, State, Liberal Arts)?
2. How does the type of school relate to increase in salary over time?
3. Does the school region has an effect on the salary?
and so on.
